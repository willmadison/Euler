WillMatt's (wmadisonDev) Project Euler Solutions
------------------------------------------------

This is simply a little repository for storing my soultions to various [Project Euler](http://projecteuler.net) problems that I've coded in Go. I haven't stated the problem numbers here at all so no spoilers for anyone on the interweb looking for solutions :o)

Cheers!
